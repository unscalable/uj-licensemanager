## üß© How It Works

- Players with the **police job (grade ‚â• 4)** or in the **admin permission group** can use the `/managelicense` command.
- A NUI interface opens, allowing the user to choose:
  - Player ID
  - License Type
  - Action (Grant or Revoke)
- The script sends data to the server which:
  - Verifies permissions again for security
  - Updates the license metadata
  - Saves changes to the database
- Players are notified of actions via `ox_lib`.
